Good afternoon, dear professors. I'm Peter Mo, the Dean of Coursera Foundation. I'll give you an overview about Coursera Foundation. About two minutes will be toke in this part.

Coursera Foundation is not a part of Coursera Company. Actually, it is an organization handled by Coursera Company. Same as Coursera Online Education, our aim is to univeralize the best education to the world. On a different way, we do it mainly offline.

To accomplish our target, we need plenty of money. look at this chart, 60% of income comes from Coursera profit, without daily maintain fees and rewards to professors. 25% comes from Foundation profits via investment and so on. Another 10% is provided by donation from government, enterprise, universities and individuals.

We use our money to bring our lectures and speeches to cities, schools, or even neighborhoods. Also, we have built fourteen primary or junior schools in South America, West Asia, and Africa.

We offer scholarship for students who did a good job, not only free online courses, but also opportunity to visit top universities who has cooperation with us to learn more knowledge. Of course, we will pay for that.

Professors can benefit from our foundation. We founded a Research Foundation as a part of Coursera Foundation. If you started a class on Coursera, you may alppy for an aid to your research project. If you want to be a visiting scholar to the Institutes who cooperate with us, Research Foundation can give you more opportunity and pay for that if your application be accepted.

As a summary, if you join us, be one of our collaborators, you can be a supporter of basic education construction of the world, and you can get a chance to be subsidized for your research and learning. If you are interested, let my colleague Kenny Pang tell you more about how to start our cooperation concretely.
